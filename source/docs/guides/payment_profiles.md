# Payment Profiles

Our Secure Payment Profile service allows merchants to create secure payment profiles, or just "profiles", for storing confidential credit card, bank account and/or contact details on our server. Transactions can then be processed against these profiles without the need to recollect payment information from the customer. Also, you do not need to store payment information on your systems. Each profile can store multiple cards. You can store a card or multiple cards with a bank account but can not store multiple bank accounts.

When you save a payment profile you will be given a customer code ID in return. This ID can be used for retrieving the profile information, updating it, and also for making payments.

Payment Profiles can be created with a plain credit card number, however we recommend that you first tokenize the card data in the client-side application and then use that token to create the profile. Payment Profiles can also be created from a past transaction using the transaction id.

Creating and modifying Secure Payment Profiles requires you use your Profiles API Key. If you get an authentication error you might be using your Payments API Key, so double check!

## Processing Steps

### Create Profile (Single-Use Token)

You should create a profile with a single-use token instead of a credit card. This is the suggested method of creating profiles since the card number never has to touch your servers, thus lowering your PCI scope.

```shell
curl -X POST https://api.na.bambora.com/v1/profiles
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
-H "Authorization: Passcode bWVyY2hhbnRfaWQ6cGFzc2NvZGU="
-d '{
      "language":"en",
      "comments":"hello",
      "token": {  
        "name":"Bill Smith",
        "code":"1eCe9480a7D94919997071a483505D17"
      }
    }'
```

### Create Profile (Card)

With this action, you can create a new payment profile tied to one individual, assigning, and validating a credit card.

```shell
curl -X POST https://api.na.bambora.com/v1/profiles
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
-H "Authorization: Passcode bWVyY2hhbnRfaWQ6cGFzc2NvZGU="
-d '{
      "language":"en",
      "comments":"hello",
      "card":{  
        "name":"Bill Smith",
        "number":"4030000010001234",
        "expiry_month":"12",
        "expiry_year":"23",
        "cvd":"123"
      }
    }'
```

### Create Profile (Bank Account)

With this action, you can create a new payment profile tied to one individual with an assigned bank account.

```shell
curl -X POST https://api.na.bambora.com/v1/profiles
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
-H "Authorization: Passcode bWVyY2hhbnRfaWQ6cGFzc2NvZGU="
-d '{
      "language":"en",
      "comments":"hello",
      "bank_account":{
        "bank_account_holder":"Bill Smith",
        "account_number":"123456",
        "bank_account_type":"Canadian",
        "institution_number":"127",
        "branch_number":"12773"
      }
    }'
```

### Create Profile (Transaction ID)

With this action, you can create a new payment profile tied to one individual with a validated credit card from a past transaction.

```shell
curl -X POST https://api.na.bambora.com/v1/profiles
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
-H "Authorization: Passcode bWVyY2hhbnRfaWQ6cGFzc2NvZGU="
-d '{
      "language":"en",
      "comments":"hello",
      "create_from_id":10000000
    }'
```


### Retrieve Profile

```shell
curl -X GET https://api.na.bambora.com/v1/profiles/{id}
-H "Authorization: Passcode bWVyY2hhbnRfaWQ6cGFzc2NvZGU="
```

### Update a Profile

```shell
curl -X PUT https://api.na.bambora.com/v1/profiles/{id}
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
-H "Authorization: Passcode bWVyY2hhbnRfaWQ6cGFzc2NvZGU="
-d '{
      "billing": {
        "name": "joh doe",
        "address_line1": "123 main st",
        "address_line2": "111",
        "city": "victoria",
        "province": "bc",
        "country": "ca",
        "postal_code": "V8T4M3",
        "phone_number": "25012312345",
        "email_address": "bill@smith.com"
      },
      "comment": "updated account"
    }'
```

### Delete a Profile

```shell
curl -X DELETE https://api.na.bambora.com/v1/profiles/{id}
-H "Authorization: Passcode bWVyY2hhbnRfaWQ6cGFzc2NvZGU="
```

### Add a Card

You can add a Card with a single-use token instead of a credit card. This is the suggested method of creating profiles since the card number never has to touch your servers, thus lowering your PCI scope.

We recommended that you add cards with a Single Use Token.

```shell
curl -X POST https://api.na.bambora.com/v1/profiles/{id}/cards
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
-H "Authorization: Passcode bWVyY2hhbnRfaWQ6cGFzc2NvZGU="
-d '{
      "token": {  
        "name":"John Doe",
        "code":"1eCe9480a7D94919997071a483505D17"
      }
  }'
```

You can also add a card using the card details.

```shell
curl -X POST https://api.na.bambora.com/v1/profiles/{id}/cards
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
-H "Authorization: Passcode bWVyY2hhbnRfaWQ6cGFzc2NvZGU="
-d '{
      "card":{
        "name":"Bill Smith",
        "number":"5100000010001004",
        "expiry_month":"02",
        "expiry_year":"14"    
      }
    }'
```

### Retrieve Cards

```shell
curl -X GET https://api.na.bambora.com/v1/profiles/{id}/cards
-H "Authorization: Passcode bWVyY2hhbnRfaWQ6cGFzc2NvZGU="
```

### Update a Card

If an account is configured to allow more than one card to the profile, only the card expiry fields can be updated.
To update the card number, a new card must be added to the profile and the invalid card can be deleted.

```shell
curl -X PUT https://api.na.bambora.com/v1/profiles/{id}/cards/{card_id}
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
-H "Authorization: Passcode bWVyY2hhbnRfaWQ6cGFzc2NvZGU="
-d '{
      "card":{
        "expiry_month":"02",
        "expiry_year":"14"    
      }
    }'
```
### Delete a Card

```shell
curl -X DELETE https://api.na.bambora.com/v1/profiles/{id}/cards/{card_id}
-H "Authorization: Passcode bWVyY2hhbnRfaWQ6cGFzc2NvZGU="
```

### Add a Bank Account

You can add a bank account to an existing profile.

```shell
curl -X PUT https://api.na.bambora.com/v1/profiles/{id}
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
-H "Authorization: Passcode bWVyY2hhbnRfaWQ6cGFzc2NvZGU="
-d '{
      "language":"en",
      "comments":"hello",
      "bank_account":{
        "bank_account_holder":"Bill Smith",
        "account_number":"12345",
        "bank_account_type":"Canadian",
        "institution_number":"123",
        "branch_number":"12345"
      }
    }'
```

```shell
curl -X PUT https://api.na.bambora.com/v1/profiles/{id}
-H "Content-Type: application/json"
-H "Authorization: Passcode bWVyY2hhbnRfaWQ6cGFzc2NvZGU="
-d '{
      "language":"en",
      "comments":"hello",
      "bank_account":{
        "bank_account_holder":"Bill Smith",
        "account_number":"123456",
